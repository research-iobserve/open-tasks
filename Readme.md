# Open iObserve Tasks

In this repositry we collect ideas and task descriptions which may result
in separate projects (i.e. a separate repository) which implement or
evaluate one part of the iObserve project.

* iobserve-ui/        development of a technical prototype of the iobserve
                      dash and ui
* analysis-service/   iObserve relies on the analysis of monitoring data
                      which is implemented with the Teetime framework and
                      Kieker. However, both frameworks do not specify how
                      such analysis can be built as an service. The idea of
                      this project is the implementation of a working
                      service.
