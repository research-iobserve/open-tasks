# iObserve Analysis Service

The iObserve analysis service is intended to collect monitoring data
from various sources, preprocess and aggregate the data, and maintain
an abstract runtime model of the observed system. In future, the
analysis service will be supplemented by additional services for 
evaluation and prediction.

= Overview =

Involved frameworks:
 * Kieker monitoring
 * Teetime pipe and filter framework
 * Kieker Teetime stages 
 * Existing iObserve stages

= Design =

The service should be realized as an Unix daemon which accepts various
TCP connections for monitoring data. Internally these connections are
handled by a Teetime based pipe and filter chain. The runtim model is
managed by a model manager using the PCM as a model (and my use CDO to
store the model in a database). It might be necessary to supplement the
PCM with additional databases.

The analysis pipeline triggers updates in the model via the model
manager realized in data sinks.
